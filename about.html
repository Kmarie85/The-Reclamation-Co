          <h1 class="h1">
            SoulStone, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
          </h1>

          <p class="lead h1-sub">
            Dedicated to providing trauma-informed, community-centered support
            for women, caregivers, and helping professionals.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            SoulStone exists to support women and caregivers who are exhausted
            by systems that ask them to perform, endure, and carry more than is
            sustainable.
          </p>

          <p class="small">
            We believe burnout is not a personal failure. It is a nervous system
            response to prolonged stress, trauma, and responsibility without
            adequate support.
          </p>

          <!-- <div class="hr"></div> -->

          <p class="small">
            SoulStone was created to offer something different. Not quick fixes.
            Not productivity hacks. Not pressure to “push through.” But
            grounded, trauma-informed spaces where people can slow down,
            reconnect to themselves, and rebuild from a place of safety.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- OUR WHY -->
        <section class="card card-pad">
          <div class="kicker">Our Why</div>
          <br>
          <h2 class="h2">Burnout is not a personal failure.</h2>

          <p class="small">
            Many of the people we serve are caregivers, helping professionals,
            women in midlife transition, survivors of chronic stress or trauma,
            and people who have spent years being “the strong one.”
          </p>

          <p class="small">
            They are capable, insightful, and deeply caring. And they are tired.
            SoulStone exists because rest, regulation, and healing should not be
            luxuries — they should be accessible, community-centered, and
            practical.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- WHAT WE BELIEVE -->
        <section class="card card-pad">
          <div class="kicker">What We Believe</div>
          <br>
          <h2 class="h2">These beliefs guide how we show up and how we work.</h2>

          <ul class="small list">
            <li>
              The nervous system matters. Healing cannot happen in constant
              urgency.
            </li>
            <li>Burnout is information, not weakness.</li>
            <li>Safety comes before growth.</li>
            <li>People heal in relationship, not isolation.</li>
            <li>You do not need to be fixed — you need to be supported.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="small">
            We believe lasting change happens when people are met with dignity,
            compassion, and tools that respect how trauma actually lives in the
            body.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- HOW WE HELP -->

          <h2 class="h2">Support that is practical, relational, and grounded in real life.</h2>

          <p class="small">
            SoulStone offers trauma-informed supports that blend education,
            embodiment, and community. Our work includes:
          </p>

          <ul class="small list">
            <li>
              Live cohorts focused on nervous-system regulation, identity
              reclamation, and sustainable change
            </li>
            <li>
              Trainings and workshops for caregivers, organizations, and helping
              professionals
            </li>
            <li>
              Grounded tools and practices people can use in real life — not
              just theory
            </li>
            <li>
              Community-based offerings that reduce isolation and restore
              connection
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- <div class="hr"></div> -->

          <p class="small">
            Our approach is not clinical, but it is informed. It is not
            prescriptive, but it is structured. It is designed to meet people
            where they are — without pressure to perform or “get it right.”
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- OUR APPROACH -->
        <section class="card card-pad">
          <div class="kicker">Our Approach</div>
          <br>
          <h2 class="h2">Trauma-informed, not trauma-centered.</h2>

          <p class="small">
            SoulStone’s work is trauma-informed, meaning we prioritize: safety,
            choice, collaboration, empowerment, and respect for lived
            experience.
          </p>

          <p class="small">
            We do not ask people to relive their trauma. We focus on
            present-moment regulation, capacity-building, and integration.
          </p>

          <p class="small">
            Healing does not require re-opening every wound. It requires
            conditions where the body and mind can finally exhale.
