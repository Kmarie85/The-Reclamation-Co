              SoulStone, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization offering
              trauma-informed, community-centered support for caregivers,

            <h2 class="h2">OUR WHY</h2>
            <p>
              Many of the people we serve are caregivers, helping professionals,
              women in midlife transition, or people who have spent years being
              “the strong one.” They are capable, insightful, and deeply caring
              — and they are tired.
            </p>
            <p>
              SoulStone exists because rest, regulation, and sustainable support
              should not be luxuries. Burnout is a nervous-system response to
              prolonged stress and responsibility, not weakness. Our work
              supports people in slowing down, reconnecting with themselves, and
              rebuilding from a place of safety and dignity — not performance or
              urgency.
